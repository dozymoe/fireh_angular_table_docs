    <h1>Widgets</h1>

    <p>All packaged widgets are set as attribute directives.

    <p>The widgets don't have to be laid in an hierarchical structure. Your
       &lt;table&gt; can be located in the middle of the page while your filter
       and sorting widget in the sidebar or somewhere else. Those scattered
       widgets will communicate by means of instance of <a href="/#/options">
       FhTableDefinition</a>.

   <h2>Demo</h2>

   <p><a href="/demos/full.html">See demo of all widgets in action</a>.

   <p>Notice that all helper widgets are outside of the scope of
      <a href="/#/widgets/fh-table">FhTable</a>, they are not inside the table
      html element, but somehow they managed to communicate with the table.
